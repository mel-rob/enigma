Enigma Project

For functionality, I would give myself a 3. I was able to get the Enigma class working with both encrypt and decrypt methods. My command-line interface works successfully and returns the expected output. I made a decision not to proceed with attempting the Crack method, and therefore would not earn a 4.

For object-oriented programming, I would give myself a 3.5. I broke the project into small, logical components that have single responsibilities. No more than 2 methods are longer than 7 lines (encrypt and decrypt). All my classes are under 50 lines and my method names clearly communicate purpose. I also created a module that is generic and project-agnostic, which serves solely to verify the correct date and key inputs. In addition, I use class methods to pull my shift over to encrypt/decrypt classes.

For test-driven development, I would give myself a 4. All test names clearly communicate the purpose of the test. At least 4 tests implement mocks and stubs, and my test coverage shows at 100%. No more than 2 commits include multiple methods, and all key functionality is contained in individual commits. 

For version control, I would give myself a 3.5. I have 83 commits and 12 pull requests named clearly with detailed descriptions.
